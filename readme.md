# Student Portfolio Expectations

### Promotion of enrollment at Base Camp
* Base Camp is a strong brand, and students leveraging that brand will help earn them gainful employment after graduation. 
* Unless already employed, portfolios should state "Base Camp Coding Academy Student" (or graduate)
* It can help if Base Camp class is included as well

### Portfolios should reflect resumes
* The portfolio should be a richer experience based on the content of resumes.
* The current path to employment for Base Camp graduates includes many hiring managers reviewing student portfolios, and all the strong talking points of their resume should be reflected on a portfolio.
* Every project should have an image associated with it. This image should be unique to that application; either a screen shot of the application running or something relevant to that project. (Do not use generic stock image)

### Elevate work samples and projects
* The marketing for Base Camp students is doing "hands-on" training, so the primary purpose of the portfolio is to demonstrate what has been created.
* Prime real-estate for the portfolio should be dedicated to promoting projects (i.e. do not bury it at the end)

### Emphasis on entry level openings
* Graduates are competitive for entry level positions and should communicate that in their portfolio.
* It is great to have aspirational goals, but take caution to communicate those with framing ("I am looking to start my career in technology, and I one day hope to be working in...")

### Ease in UX (user experience)
* It is a requirement that your portfolio is mobile responsive. This not only helps with UX, but mobile responsive technology is necessary for 2020.
* In no instance, should anyone have to click to view content for a portfolio. If it cannot be viewed without scrolling, fix that.
* As much as possible fit all the necessary information onto a single screen.
* Be mindful of negative space, and fill accordingly.

### Avoid oversharing personal information
* The information in your portfolio should only go to increase your candidacy for employment.
* Extraneous information can become a liability. If it is not appropriate for a job interview, do not include it.

### Work curation is portfolio curation
* Portfolios can be improved by writing a strong readme for a project
* Demonstrating 100% test coverage for a project can show maturity
* Well articulated version control messages can show attention to detail

### Do Personalize!
* Include a picture of you, it can help build a familiarity with a future employer
* Ever heard of a favicon? How about a well titled portfolio?
* Interested people need to be able to connect, so posting access to linkedin is the bare minimum
